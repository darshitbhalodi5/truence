          <h2>Program Scope</h2>
          <p>
            The Watchdog program applies to all instances of misused funds across DAO initiatives. This includes, but is not limited to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Grant allocations where funds are used contrary to the original proposal or intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Incentive programs where funds are diverted or misappropriated for non-approved activities.</li>
            <li>Other DAO-funded initiatives where the misuse of funds can compromise financial integrity or reputation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The program is retroactive—covering past funding rounds—and will apply to all future allocations, ensuring comprehensive oversight.
